		 * Four Pillars of OOP:
		 * 1> Abstraction
		 * The essential features of an entity
		 * Example of Abstraction: we don't know the dimensions of a triangle but know what a triangle looks like.
		 * Another example is a table. We know that a table is made up of four legs and a flat surface on top
		 * 
		 * 2> Encapsulation
		 * Hiding the inner working of our code so that certain methods are only accessible to certain areas of the code. 
		 * This helps us to ensure that an object or class we create can't be manipulated in a way it is not supposed to
		 * Example: When Driving, we only need to know how to steer, shift, break and accelerate. We do not need to know 
		 * how the cylinders fire or engine runs to operate the vehicle. This is all encapsulated and the user is only given the public
		 * Pieces of the car to operate it
		 * 
		 * 3> Inheritance
		 * In the same way that we inherit traits from our parents or ancestors, OOP allows objects to inherit from parent objects, 
		 * or classes, to be more precise
		 * 
		 * 4> Polymorphism
		 * This means that something can take different forms.
		 * Example: There are different types of animals and they all have their own way of communication
		 * Dog - Bark
		 * Cat - Meow
		 * Bear - Growl
		 * Each implementation of communication is a little different and take different forms.
		 * 
		 * Class -  Is how we structure  our code in OOP
		 * class is like a blueprint
		 * object is the actual product developed from the blueprint
		 * If you have a blueprint of a house, you don't actually have a house until you build it
		 * If we have a class of dog, we don't actually have any instances of dog until actually create them
		 * An object is an instance of a class
